## 1. MONSOONAL NORTH WEST
The Monsoonal North West sub-cluster, comprising NRM regions in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, commonly known as the tropical ‘top end’. This region experiences a pronounced wet and dry season.

The Monsoonal North West covers tropical rainforests, wetlands and arid rangelands of the Northern Territory, and the steep mountain ranges of the Ord and Fitzroy River catchments of the Kimberley. Bordering along the north is the Timor Sea, while the Gulf of Carpentaria lies along the eastern edges. There is an extensive series of river systems in this cluster, including the Liverpool, Alligator, Daly, Finke, McArthur, Roper, Todd and Victoria Rivers

## 2. WET TROPICS
The Wet Tropics cluster comprises four NRM regions in northern Queensland. The cluster contains considerable biodiversity assets, for example within national parks and the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area.

The climate of this cluster is characterised by two seasons; the monsoonal wet season (from around December to April), which is dominated by prevailing north-westerly winds, and the dry season (May to November), when south-easterly trade winds dominate.

## 3. MONSOONAL NORTH EAST
The Monsoonal North East sub-cluster, comprising NRM regions of the Northern and Southern Gulf as well as the Burdekin in northern Queensland. This region experiences a pronounced wet and dry season.

The Monsoonal North East covers relatively intact savannah woodland and important rainforest areas as well as the Mitchell, Gilbert, Norman and Staaten River catchments, all of which flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Burdekin region also includes the very wet coastal plains of the lower Burdekin river.

## 13. RANGELANDS SOUTH
The Rangelands South sub-cluster comprises parts of NRM regions in three States, extending from the Indian Ocean to the Great Australian Bight and to western New South Wales. The split of Rangelands is motivated by the bioregions that result from the seasonal rainfall distribution. Much of the South regularly receives rainfall in winter, with only intermittent rainfall in other seasons. Many Indigenous Australians live in this region. Cattle and sheep grazing are important agricultural activities.

## 15. RANGELANDS NORTH
The Rangelands North sub-cluster comprises NRM regions in four States and the Northern Territory, extending from the Indian Ocean to northwestern New South Wales. This vast region contains many varied landscapes, including the ranges of the Pilbara and ‘The Centre’; hence much of the iconic ‘Outback’. Many Indigenous Australians live in this region. Cattle grazing is an important agricultural activity.

Rainfall systems vary from seasonally reliable monsoonal influences in the far north of the sub-cluster through to very low and variable rainfall patterns in much of the centre.
